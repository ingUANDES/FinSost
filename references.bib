  abstract = {State sponsored retirement plans have been proposed and implemented to provide people with new access to defined contribution retirement opportunities. Many of these people have no other options and typically have low income and are less educated. We study optimal plan implementation in a theoretical model and analyze how the right menu of portfolio options and default option should be chosen based on the financial sophistication of the participants, their behavioral biases, the prevalent political philosophy, and the political economy. The paper provides several novel positive and normative implications, which appear to be empirically plausible.},

  abstract = {Eye-tracking is widely used throughout the scientific community, from vision science and psycholinguistics to marketing and human-computer interaction. Surprisingly, there is little consistency and transparency in preprocessing steps, making replicability and reproducibility difficult. To increase replicability, reproducibility, and transparency, a package in R (a free and widely used statistical programming environment) called gazeR was created to read and preprocess two types of data: gaze position and pupil size. For gaze position data, gazeR has functions for reading in raw eye-tracking data, formatting it for analysis, converting from gaze coordinates to areas of interest, and binning and aggregating data. For data from pupillometry studies, the gazeR package has functions for reading in and merging multiple raw pupil data files, removing observations with too much missing data, eliminating artifacts, blink identification and interpolation, subtractive baseline correction, and binning and aggregating data. The package is open-source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/dmirman/gazer. We provide step-by-step analyses of data from two tasks exemplifying the packageâ€™s capabilities.},
